User-to-user messaging app for Django
=====================================

This is a basic messaging application for the django web-framework, please
see the /docs/ directory for more information. 

I am currently updating this repo to conform to Django 1.4 - the 0.4.4 version of 
Django-Messages has several deprecated functions that cause breakage. Please feel 
free to contribute, or point me in the right direction if the work has already been done!

Thanks,

Jim
